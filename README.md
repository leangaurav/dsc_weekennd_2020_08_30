# Maintain Folder Structure:
- For assignments there is a folder Assignment. All assignments will be present there classwise.
  Ex: Assignment010, Assignment020....
- PPT folder will contain PPTs 
- Root of repo will contain the notebooks and scripts done in the class
- Use Python Identifier naming convention for file or folder names (use alphabets and underscores. Don't use spaces etc.)
  ex: Assignment\gaurav_gupta\assignment1.txt

# During first push
- configure global username and password in git.
- while pushing for first time, a popup window will open asking for github username and password.

# Steps to Commit/ Add/ Push files to main repository 
1. check untracked files via `git status`
2. add untracked file `git add <filename>` or `git add *` Prefer first method over the other
3. Commit your changes `git commit -m "meaningful message"`
4. Push your changes to the repo `git push`

# Before You Commit !!
- Before you commit always do a git pull.
- If a folder by assignment doesn't exist, create the folder and push.
- If folder exists add solution by your name.

# Commit format and Solution Format
- Create a folder by your name in Assignments folder where you will put your solution files. 
- If your name is already taken create with a number at end
- Upload assignments as plain text files with all solutions for one assignment in a single file.
- Use this format
  
  Let File be Assignment1.txt. Its content should look like this 
  Q1
  Solution
  
  Q2
  Solution  
  ...

- Do not upload any PDF or Doc files.
- For projects upload as .zip files with a readme.txt describing how to use your code.
- Maintain common sense and write simple code :-P


# And most important. If you are added as collaborator, it means you can delete things. 
# Don't mess with other peoples' stuff :)
# Especially mine :-P
